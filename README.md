# Multi100 Project

## Task 01

The first task is to replicate an original analysis and draw a single
conclusion about the presence of an effect or relationship. The paper I
replicated is: "_Does Warfare Matter? Severity, Duration, and Outcomes of Civil
Wars_" by Laia Balcells and Stathis Kalyvas (2014). The data and scripts of the
original study are available at:
<https://osf.io/3j72h/?view_only=5b822a6c354940c5a5127c97d2c588fd>. The
authors' claim is that "_irregular conflicts last_ [...] _longer than all other
types of conflict_ [...] (p. 1390)."

The replication provides support for the original hypothesis.
